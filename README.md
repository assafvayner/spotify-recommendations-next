# Spotify recommendations dashboard

Presenting a UI enabling searching for artists and songs and then get song recommendations.
Powered by Spotify search and recommendation API's.
Using nextjs framework in typescript.

In order to run in development mode or deployed must create a `.env.local` file with the environment variables listed in `sample.env.local` with spotify web api credentials.

The design is rather rough around the edges and I did not stress test many weird cases so may not always function as expected.
